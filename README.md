# HadoopDB
MapReduce and DBMS - Working together for Analytical Workload

Abstract
========

Many enterprises are shifting away from deploying their analytical databases on high-propietary machines, and moving towards cheaper, lower-end, commodity hardware, typically arranged in a shared-nothing MPP architecture.

There tend to be two schools of thought regarding what technology to use for big data analysis. Proponents of parallel databases argue that the strong emphasis on performance and efficiency of parallel databases make them well suited to perform such analysis.
